# Machine Turing Emulator

___
**Main info**

Turing machine emulation system

**Technical task**

System should perform the following functions:
1) system-wide functions:
+ issuance of reference information about the system;
+ semantic analysis of the command;
+ syntactic analysis of the command;
+ semantic analysis of the algorithm;
+ step-by-step display of the tape head position;
+ step-by-step display of Turing machine commands;
+ automatic display on the tape;
2) user functions:
- adjusting the length of the tape;
- creation of the alphabet;
- editing the alphabet;
  + creation/editing of the algorithm:
  + adding columns in the algorithm;
  + removal of columns in the algorithm;
- team editing;
+ loading the algorithm from a file;
+ saving the algorithm to a file;
+ choice of preset algorithm;
+ choice of method for specifying operands;
- assignment of operands in numerical form;
- assignment of operands in symbolic form;
+ choice of algorithm execution mode;
+ setting the parameters of time intervals for visualization of work with the Turing machine.

**About project**

Desktop application. All algorithms are written in pure Java language. The JavaFX framework was used to write the interface.
